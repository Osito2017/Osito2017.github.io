Okay, this is an extremely noobish documentation on how jailbreaks work, on a coding level. This is being made for me to better understand coding and teaching my very confused girlfriend. Love you honey :)  

#Firstly, what is a jailbreak?????
Jailbreaking essentially disables all security protocals to allow the signing of (once before jailbreaking) unsigned code by the kernel.

#Three different types of jailbreaks; Userland, iBoot, and Bootrom
The first one, Userlands, "allow user level access (admin privlages) but doesn't allow iboot level access. This exploit can be patched in a future firmware update." That means that this exploit doesn't allow us to affect the iBoot, or the 2nd boot sequence when the phone is powered on.
An iBoot exploit means we can gain user level access and allows us to gain access to the 2nd boot sequence when the phone is powered on.
The most glorious of all of these jailbreaks is known as a BootRom exploit and can only be replaced with new hardware. All devices with A4 chips (iPod 4, iPhone 4, iPhone 3gs (old bootrom)) are affected by a bootrom exploit called limera1n, meaning forever jailreakable.
